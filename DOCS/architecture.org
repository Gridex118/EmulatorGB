* CPU
The Game Boy used a custom CPU, the DMG-CPU (CPU-CGB, for the Color) by Sharp.
+ Used the Sharp SM83 as it's main processing unit.
+ Clocked at ~4.19MHz, originally; and upgraded to ~8.38MHz in the Game Boy Color.
+ Memory mapped I/O
+ 7 general purpose registers
+ For compatibility reasons, CPU-CGB had two modes:
  - Normal mode, at 4.19MHz
  - Dual speed mode, at 8.38 MHz
+ 8 bit data bus
+ 16 bit address bus: can address upto 64 KB of memory. The memory map was split at:
  - Cartridge's ROM
  - Work RAM    :: 8KiB(32KiB for the Color) WRAM, general purpose
  - High RAM    :: additional 127B HRAM, accessed via the =LDH= instruction
  - Display RAM :: 8KiB of VRAM, for graphics
  - I/O mapping
  - Interrupt controls
